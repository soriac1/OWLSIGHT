# OWLSIGHT
SCSU Building locator 
This is 330 project I wroked on in a group, where I handled the backend of this project along with Jasdip. The other 2 partners worked on the front end of the website
This project was about helping students at our school locate their classes by giving us the class name, building name, room number, and name of professor.
by addign this information it would activate a gps locator to navigate students to the correct building, while adding photos to direct them to their class.
